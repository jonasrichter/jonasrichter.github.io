          <h2> Looking back on 2022 </h2>
          <h6> 19. December 2022 </h6>
          <br>
         
          <h5> Slowly but surely, the year 2022 is 
coming to an end. 
And what a year it has been. After two years of online workshops due 
to the Corona pandemic, I was finally able to visit an in-person conference 
again - the APS March Meeting in Chicago. The hybrid version was a little weird 
and there were definitely a couple of things that didn't work as 
smoothly as they should have. But it was still great to see so many 
physicists, 
meet up with some colleagues and friends, and simply visit a new place that I 
haven't been to before. For me, visiting the March Meeting each year (or the 
Spring Meeting of the German Physical Society) is a nice 
tradition which also serves as an important source of my motivation. The 
fixed date every year and the goal of presenting cool new results 
always gives me a little extra push to get some projects done. I am 
already looking forward to the March Meeting 2023, which will take place in 
Las Vegas - definitely very exciting! </h5> 
<br>
<h5> What else (as far as physics is concerned) happened in 2022? Overall, I 
was quite busy with juggling multiple projects simultaneously (I guess 
many postdocs can relate) and trying to make progress in all of them. In March, 
I already knew that I was going to leave London in September to move on to my 
new 
position in the US. During the summer, I therefore ambitiously aimed to 
wrap up all my running projects, such that I can start my 
Marie-Curie project without too much "ballast". I am happy to say that I more 
or less managed to achieve this goal. I am also quite happy how 2022 
turned out in terms of publications and, at least for me personally, I can say 
that I learned a lot of new stuff from the projects that I worked on. In August 
and September, I also attended three other in-person conferences, 
namely a workshop at the MPIPKS in Dresden, the German Spring Meeting in 
Regensburg (which was postponed to September), and a workshop taking place 
in the picturesque Logar Valley in Slovenia. All three were a lot of fun, but 
especially the last one in Slovenia turned out to be absolutely 
amazing in terms of location, food, and obviously physics! 
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
Now, it's December and Christmas is around the corner. This seems 
like a good time for a quick review of some of the research that I did this 
year (or rather a review of the general field that I am working in). I will 
try to keep this superficial, so if you want to learn more please feel 
free to check out my <a 
href="https://jonasrichter.github.io/#publications">publications</a> and, of 
course, the references cited therein. </h5>
  
  <!-- <h5> <b>Transport in low-dimensional spin chains</b>  </h5> -->
<h5>One research area that I am especially interested in is <b>thermalization 
in 
isolated quantum many-body systems</b>. That is, studying if and how a quantum 
system, initially prepared in an out-of-equilibrium state, evolves towards 
thermal equilibrium at long times. If the quantum system additionally 
possesses 
a global conservation law, the process of thermalization is closely 
connected with the <b>transport properties</b> of the system. Consider, for 
instance, 
a system of N particles moving in 
a one-dimensional lattice with discrete sites and interacting with 
each 
other. Often, one encounters problems where the overall particle number N 
is conserved, that is, there are no terms in the Hamiltonian that add or remove 
a particle from the system. Now, imagine that the system is prepared in a state 
with all particles in the left half, while all lattice sites in the right half
are empty. Clearly, this is a far-from-equilibrium state, since in 
equilibrium we would expect a globally homogeneous distribution of the 
particles. In order for the system to reach thermal equilibrium, particles thus 
have to be transported from the left to the right. </h5>

<h5>
These transport processes 
are typically rather slow compared to other relevant time scales in the system. 
Therefore, in order to understand the time scale of eventual thermalization, 
it is crucial to investigate the transport properties. For generic, 
non-fine-tuned systems, a naive first guess is that the particles behave 
diffusively as if they would undergo a random walk on average. While diffusion 
is arguably the default expectation is the case of classical physics, its 
emergence in the quantum world is actually not entirely obvious. Nevertheless, 
diffusive transport is 
routinely found in (numerical) experiments in a variety of isolated quantum 
many-body systems, and a series of recent influential works have put these 
observations on firm theoretical footing. However, despite this progress, it 
still remains a remarkably challenging problem to actually extract quantitative 
values for the corresponding diffusion constants even with state-of-the-art 
analytical or numerical approaches. Furthermore, while models with diffusion 
might be the rule, there are also interesting exceptions that show anomalous 
types of transport such as fast <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06309"> 
superdiffusion</a> or slower <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13612"> 
subdiffusion</a>. </h5> 

<!--<h5>
Interestingly, diffusion is not the only type of transport that can 
occur in a quantum system. Notably, there exist models that exhibit certain 
kinetic constraints, which can act as bottlenecks and slow down the transport. 
In such models, slow anomalous subdiffusion can emerge where, depending on the 
specific form of the constraints. In addition, while many models 
only have short-ranged (say nearest-neighbor) interactions, long-range 
interactions 
where the strength of the interaction decays as a power-law in space. In 
particular, if     </h5> -->
  
 <!--  <h5> <b>Many-body localization</b>  </h5> -->
 <h5>While the vast majority of quantum many-body systems eventually reaches 
thermal equilibrium under their own unitary dynamics, some selected types of 
systems are believed to evade this thermal fate. A popular example are 
strongly disordered models undergoing a <b>many-body localization</b> 
transition. These models behave as insulators (that is, no transport) even at 
finite temperatures.   
Many-body localization has been an exceptionally active research area in the 
last 
two decades but, rather recently, there have been quite a few new developments. 
Regions in parameter space that were originally believed to be strongly 
localized are now often interpreted as thermalizing, albeit on astronomically 
long time scales. This already summarizes the main problem when studying MBL. 
Essentially, in order to unambiguously decide if a quantum system indeed 
localizes or, more formally, if many-body localization is indeed a stable phase 
of matter, one would have to study 
systems of infinite size and up to infinite times. In practice, this is simply 
impossible both for experiments as well as for numerics. Nevertheless, we have 
tried to make <a 
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10498">some progress</a> by coming up with 
helpful numerical tricks and by looking at models that have received 
comparatively less attention so far. </h5>
   
 <!--   <h5> <b>Random circuit models</b>  </h5> -->
<h5>Studying the dynamics of quantum systems is generally quite challenging. 
On the one hand, analytical solutions are rather rare and often apply only 
to certain fine-tuned models. On the other hand, numerical approaches, 
while certainly extremely useful, are pushed to their limits due to 
the exponential complexity of many-body quantum systems. Motivated by these 
challenges, and thanks to helpful influences from the field of quantum 
information, a new framework has become quite popular in recent years: 
<b>random quantum circuits</b>. These circuits are designed as minimally 
structured 
models to describe the universal aspects of quantum dynamics. They exhibit some 
key properties, such 
as locality, unitarity, and potentially the presence of conservation laws, 
but are otherwise as unstructured as possible. In some cases, this 
randomness has the advantage that one can actually obtain analytical insights 
that would have been inaccessible otherwise. Moreover, certain classes of 
circuits can be simulated efficiently even on classical computers for huge 
system sizes. This applies in particular to circuits composed of so-called 
Clifford gates, which are very well-known in the quantum-information community 
but only recently got attention of physicists working on questions in 
condensed-matter or quantum many-body physics. It is definitely a lot of fun to 
suddenly be able to 
simulate systems with thousands of lattice sites, whereas before one was 
already happy to handle a few dozens of particles. Understanding which 
phenomena these circuits can or cannot capture is one area I am currently 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10129">interested in</a>.</h5>
 <br>
 <h5> So, what's next? I have several things on my list that I want to learn 
more about and that I plan to work on. As usual, 2023 
promises to be a busy year. Now, in the final days before the Christmas break, 
I will try to start as many simulations as possible and let them run on big 
computer clusters. Hopefully, these simulations will produce some nice data 
for the projects that I am currently working 
on. Letting 
the computers do the hard work while I get some days off always feels very 
satisfying!  </h5>
<br>
<h5>Finally, I share two pictures with you that I took this year. The first one 
is from the March Meeting in Chicago and shows the bright green river thanks 
to St. Patrick's Day. The other one shows the Logar Valley, Slovenia, with the 
beautiful 
view that we got to enjoy from the conference hotel for one week.
