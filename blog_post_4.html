          <h2> Hydrodynamics in long-range systems with kinetic constraints 
</h2>
          <h6> 18. May 2023 </h6>
          <br>
           
          <h5>
         In the last few months, together with my collaborators Alan 
Morningstar and Nick O'Dea, we worked on a project studying the competition 
of long-range interactions and center-of-mass conservation, and their 
impact on transport properties of many-body systems. We published a paper that 
can be found on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12354">arXiv</a>. In 
this blog post, I want to tell you about some of our findings in a, hopefully, 
relatively easy to understand way. 
          </h5>
<br>
<h5>
Broadly speaking, hydrodynamics describes the long-time evolution of conserved 
quantities from local to global equilibrium. More specifically, 
consider for instance a system with a conserved number of particles, e.g., 
particles hopping 
on a chain composed of discrete lattice sites, where the initial particle 
distribution is slightly inhomogeneous. Clearly, this is a nonequilibrium 
situation since in equilibrium the particle number would be the same on every 
site. If the particles now hop randomly to nearest-neighboring lattice sites, 
driven by the finite gradient of the particle density, then this 
random-walk-like dynamics would on average be described by diffusive 
hydrodynamics.  
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
Understanding the 
emergence of such hydrodynamics in many-body quantum systems is a 
highly challenging and actively pursued research question. Likewise, 
it is an intriguing question what classes of hydrodynamics, e.g., some 
anomalous types of transport other than just standard diffusion, can arise in 
certain systems.     
In this context, our study was motivated by two different 
directions:
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
On one hand, it has been shown in recent works that models with 
kinetic constraints can feature slow subdiffusive transport. One 
popular example are systems with higher-order conservation laws, e.g., in 
addition to the number of particles, the center-of-mass of the particles is 
conserved as well. The slower transport can be understood from the fact that 
the additional condition of conserving the center-of-mass restricts the 
mobility of the particles. 
Importantly, such kinds of systems are not just of theoretical interest, but 
can actually be realized in experiments. For instance, in cold-atom platforms, 
the center-of-mass conservation can effectively be induced by tilting the 
optical lattice. 
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
On the other hand, in contrast to constraint systems, faster than diffusive 
transport can be achieved in systems with long-range interactions. Consider for 
instance a situation where particles can hop to far-away sites, but the 
probability for such a long-range hop decreases (as a power law) with 
increasing distance, e.g., \( \propto |i-j|^{-\nu} \). Depending on the value 
of \(\nu \), transport in these systems can be diffusive (as in strictly 
short-range models), but also superdiffusive or faster (see also one of my 
previous <a 
href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.L012031">publications</a> for 
more details and many references). Importantly, long-range interactions are 
ubiquitous in nature and should be familiar to you also from other contexts 
(e.g., Coulomb interaction). Therefore, similar to the 
center-of-mass-conserving systems introduced above, it is not surprising that 
understanding the 
physics of systems with long-range interactions is immediately relevant to 
experiments, e.g., in trapped-ion platforms or in experiments with polar 
molecules. 
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
A natural question is now what classes of hydrodynamics can emerge in models, 
where long-range interactions which 
facilitate faster transport, compete with center-of-mass conservation which 
constrains transport. A convenient starting point to study this question is 
provided by pair-hopping models described by the Hamiltonian, 
</h5>
<h5><span class="math display">\[H = \sum_x \sum_{s,r} J_{sr} \left(S_{x}^+ 
S_{x+r}^- S_{x+r+s}^- S_{x + s + 2r}^+ + \text{h.c.}\right)\]</span></h5>
<h5>
where the \(S_x^\pm \) are quantum spin operators at lattice site \(x \). More 
specifically, these ladder operators lead to an increase (decrease) of the \(z 
\) component of the spin. Inspecting the terms in \(H \), one finds that 
spin-flips can only occur in pairs. That is, a spin excitation can only travel 
from \(x+r \) to \(x \) if simultaneously an excitation travels from \(x+r+s 
\) to \(x + s + 2r \). The opposite process can occur as well (denoted by \( 
\mathrm{h.c.}\)). Note that in this way, the 
Hamiltonian conserves both the total magnetization \(\sum_x S_x^z\) as well as 
the associated dipole moment \(\sum_x x S_x^z\).  
</h5>
<br>
<h5> 
In the previous paragraph,  I have switched language from "particles" to 
"spins", and from "center-of-mass" to "dipole moment". This is quite a popular 
mapping which is often used by condensed-matter physicists. Simply pick the 
picture you are most comfortable working with! Going back to particles (for 
the moment), the pair-hopping processes described by \(H \) can be illustrated 
as shown in the following image: 
</h5>

<h5>
Apparently, there are two relevant length scales. A "hopping" distance \(r \) 
and a "pairing" distance \(s \). The strengths of the terms in \(H \) with 
different \(s \) and \(r \) will be encoded by the coupling coefficient 
\(J_{sr} \). As discussed further below, we will particularly consider cases 
where \(J_{sr} \) decays with increasing \(s \) and \(r \). 
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
Studying quantum dynamics is unfortunately extremely challenging. While 
analytical approaches are comparatively rare, numerical methods are limited to 
rather small system sizes due to the exponentially increasing complexity of 
quantum systems. Therefore, we here proceed differently and consider a 
classical system of particles (or rather some coarse-grained cells), whose 
dynamics is generated by a master 
equation that incorporates the pair-hopping processes shown in the above 
picture. 
</h5>
<h5><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\dot{n}_x = \sum_{r,s} C_{sr} [ 
    &-(n_{x-2r-s} - n_{x-r-s} - n_{x-r} + n_{x})  \\[-1em]
    &+(n_{x-r-s} - n_{x-s} - n_{x} + n_{x+r})  \\
    &+(n_{x-r} - n_{x} - n_{x+s} + n_{x+s+r})  \\
    &-(n_{x} - n_{x+r} - n_{x+s+r} + n_{x+s+2r})
    ]
\end{align}
\]</span></h5>
<h5> 
Here, \(n_x \) is the particle density at site \(x \), and the four lines of 
the 
master equation correspond to the four different ways this density can change 
due to pair-hopping processes involving the distances \(s \) and \(r \). The 
amplitude of these processes is set by the coefficients \(C_{sr} \) for which 
we here choose the form 
</h5>
<h5><span class="math display">\[C_{sr} = \frac{1}{(s+1)^\alpha 
r^\beta}\]</span></h5>
<h5> 
Thus, \(s \) and \(r \) are individually controlled by the two exponents 
\( \alpha \) and \( \beta \). Long-range interactions correspond to 
small values of \( \alpha, \beta \). Generally, the idea of this approach is 
that the hydrodynamics described by the classical master equation correctly 
captures the emerging hydrodynamics in microscopic quantum systems. 
While this 
is not obvious, the believe is that chaotic 
highly excited quantum systems at long times behave essentially classically 
and that the resulting hydrodynamics should be universal (and we indeed 
provide evidence for this in our paper, but I won't discuss this any 
further here). Note that, following a 
Fermi's Golden rule argument, a meaningful comparison of the master equation and 
the quantum Hamiltonian \(H \) requires to choose the coupling 
coefficients as \(J_{sr} \sim \sqrt{C_{sr}} \).
</h5>
<br> 
<h5> 
It is now instructive to consider two distinct limiting cases: (i) \(\beta \to 
\infty \), which corresponds to \(r \to 1 \). The hopping distance is thus
short range while the pairing distance \(s \) can be long-ranged.  (ii) 
\(\alpha \to 
\infty \), which corresponds to \(s \to 0 \). In this case, \(r \) can be 
long-ranged while \(s \) is small. We can analyze the master equation 
analytically as well as numerically, focusing on the regime of long times and 
long wavelengths where hydrodynamics is expected to emerge. Sparing you the 
details, the phase diagram that we obtain for the cases (i) and (ii) is 
summarized below. 
</h5>

<h5>
As can be seen, the effects of \(s \) and \(r \) (or \( \alpha \) and \( \beta 
\) ) are somewhat different. Specifically, in the case of a short-range hopping 
distance, the fastest achievable transport is diffusive. This results from a 
local breakdown of the center-of-mass conservation. In contrast, if the pairing 
distance remains short-ranged but hops can be long-ranged, transport can become 
arbitrarily fast with the dynamical exponent \(z \to 0 \). Eventually, if \( 
\beta \) becomes too small, locality breaks down and the model essentially 
behaves as if it would have all-to-all connectivity. In this limit, 
hydrodynamics breaks down as well since any kind of inhomogeneity would relax 
basically 
instantaneously. 
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
While understanding the above "toy model" is already quite interesting, the 
question is of course if such physics is also relevant to actual 
realistic systems. As already mentioned above, a good candidate in this context 
are quantum systems in a linear potential. Specifically, consider the so-called 
long-range XY model, 
</h5> 
<h5><span class="math display">\[H_\text{XY} = \sum_{i \lt j} 
\frac{J}{|i-j|^\nu} (\sigma^+_i \sigma^-_j + 
\sigma^-_i \sigma^+_j) + F \sum_i i n_i\]</span></h5>

<h5> 
The \( \sigma^\pm_i \) denote Pauli matrices which describe spin-\(1/2 \) 
degrees of 
freedom. \(J \) sets the energy scale of the interactions whose decay is 
controlled by the exponent \( \nu \). Moreover, the strength of the tilt is 
given by \(F \). Note that the term \( \sum_i i n_i 
\), where \(n_i = (\sigma_i^z + 1)/2 \), precisely corresponds to the "center 
of 
mass" of the spins. 
In the case where \( F \gg J\), the tilt is the dominant term and the 
center-of-mass (dipole moment) is effectively conserved, at least on 
exponentially long time scales. In order to understand the dynamics of 
\(H_\text{XY} \) at strong tilts, one can perform a 
Schrieffer-Wolff transformation to obtain an effective model which describes 
the relevant processes in this regime. While you can check out our paper for 
the details, I here want to take an easier route and simply consider some 
example hopping-processes that conserve the center-of-mass and the energy of 
the system:     
</h5>
       
            <div class="container">

     <div class="section-title">
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="block-lg-6" data-aos="fade-right">
            <img src="assets/img/research/Virtual_Hops.png" class="img-fluid 
max-width: 
45%" 
alt=""> </div>

               </div>
       </div>
       </div>
       
<h5>
The effective amplitude \(J_\text{eff} \) of these third-order processes can be 
obtained as usual in perturbation theory by multiplying the interaction 
strength \( \propto 
|i-j|^{-\nu} \) by the energy denominator \(1/E \). In this way, one can also 
show that lower-order processes don't contribute as their amplitudes cancel 
out. As becomes apparent from the above image, the combination of long-range 
interactions and strong lattice tilt in the XY model indeed leads to 
pair-hopping processes with distances \(s \) and \(r \). However, the power-law 
dependence of these effective hoppings differs from the 
simpler form of the \(C_{sr} \) that we studied above: 
</h5>
<h5><span class="math display">\[J_\text{eff} \propto \frac{J^3}{F^2} 
\frac{1}{r^{\nu+1}(r+s)^{\nu+1}} \left( \frac{1}{s^\nu} - 
\frac{1}{(2r+s)^\nu}\right) \]</span></h5>
<h5> 

</h5>
<br>
<h5> 
It now turns out that, using this expression of \( J_\text{eff} \) as a 
starting point for a corresponding classical master equation, we numerically 
find that subdiffusion with dynamical exponent \(z = 4 \) appears extremely 
stable and persists down to very small values of \( \nu \). This can be 
understood from the fact that these are third-order processes, such that 
reducing \( 
\nu \) has a weaker effect. It thus seems challenging to realize 
in experiments with tilted systems all the different phases with 
continuously varying \(z \) shown in the above 
phase diagram. Finding ways to realize these phases is an interesting direction 
of prospective research.
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
Overall, this was an extremely fun project that started from some informal 
discussions and seminar talks. I hope I can continue to work on 
similar questions in the future.
