          <h5>
Hi everyone, the winter break is over and the year 2024 is well on its way. 
My previous year, working as a Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie scholar in the US, 
has been incredibly rewarding and challenging at the same time. I might write 
about my experiences in more detail in a future post.   
    </h5>
 <br>
 <h5>
 Today, however, I would like to tell you about a topic that is close to my 
heart, namely the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). The ETH has 
been one 
of my main research interests over the last few years. While similar ideas have 
been around for quite some time, one of the pioneering works, that can be seen 
as one of ETH's starting points, has been a paper published in 1994 by Mark 
Srednicki, see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.50.888">here</a>. Now, 
for its 30th anniversary, it seems fitting to use today's blog post for a 
(brief and subjective) review. While the subject is quite extensive, I will 
particularly provide my personal perspective on the ETH, with a focus on some 
recent developments.
          </h5>
<br>
<h5>
The basic question that we are trying to understand is the following: How does 
an isolated quantum system relax to thermal equilibrium? Initially, this 
question seems basic and rather silly. After all, from our everyday experience, 
we know that everything around us has the tendency to thermalize. Examples 
include  
a hot cup of coffee that will cool down to room temperature, or the ice cubes 
in your favorite cocktail that will melt over time if you don't finish the 
drink quickly enough. In particular, the famous Second Law of Thermodynamics 
tells us 
that all matter, when left on its own, approaches over the course of time a 
configuration that maximizes its entropy.    
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
From a microscopic perspective, however, the fact that systems routinely 
reach thermal equilibrium is less obvious. Namely, given an 
isolated quantum system, prepared in some (out-of-equilibrium) quantum state 
\(|\psi\rangle \), the time evolution of the system is described by the 
Schrödinger equation,  
</h5>
<h5><span class="math display">\[ |\psi(t)\rangle = e^{-iHt} |\psi(0)\rangle = 
\sum_m c_m e^{-iE_mt}|m\rangle\ 
, \]</span></h5>
<h5>
where \(H\) is the Hamiltonian of the system and we have written 
\(|\psi(0)\rangle\) in terms of the eigenstates \(|m\rangle\) of \(H\) with 
eigenvalues \(E_m\). 
Apparently, the state will evolve without any obvious stationary fixed point 
(i.e., the eigenstates continue to acquire a phase factor depending on 
\(E_m\)). 
Nevertheless, in practice, we certainly do observe that the properties of most 
quantum 
systems, after some 
initial transient dynamics, indeed become approximately time 
independent and 
can be described by an appropriate thermodynamic ensemble. In fact, this not 
only applies to the above macroscopic systems, such as the cup of coffee, but 
also to microscopic isolated quantum systems, which can nowadays be realized to 
very good quality in various experimental platforms. 
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
The key 
insight in order to understand thermalization, is to look at the behavior of 
observable expectation values (instead of just the state \(|\psi\rangle \)),  
 </h5>
 <h5><span class="math display">\[ \langle O(t) \rangle = \langle 
\psi(t)|O|\psi(t)\rangle\ , \]</span></h5>
 <h5>
with \(O\) being a physical (i.e., typically local) observable. From a 
mathematical point of view, observables are given by Hermitian matrices. The 
structure of these matrices (when written in the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian) 
provides insights into the occurrence of thermalization. This can be seen when 
expanding the above expression of the time-dependent expectation value,
</h5>
 <h5><span class="math display">\[ \langle O(t) \rangle = \sum_{m,n} 
c_n^\ast c_m e^{-i(E_m-E_n)t} \langle n|O|m\rangle \\ \qquad \qquad \qquad 
\qquad \quad = \sum_{m=n} |c_m|^2 O_{mm} + \sum_{m\neq n} c_n^\ast c_m 
e^{-i(E_m-E_n)t} O_{mn}  \ ,  \]</span></h5>
<h5>
where again \(|\psi\rangle = \sum_m c_m |m\rangle\) and 
\(|m\rangle \) are the eigenstates of \(H\) with eigenvalues \(E_m\). In the 
long-time limit, only the first sum with \(m = n\) will contribute since 
the terms 
in the second sum will approximately cancel out each other due to the quickly 
oscillating complex exponential function. Thermalization can then be understood 
by assuming that the matrix structure of \(O\) is given by the following Ansatz 
(proposed by Srednicki), 
</h5>
 <h5><span class="math display">\[O_{mn} = O(\bar{E})\delta_{mn} + 
\Omega^{-\frac{1}{2}}(\bar{E})f(\bar{E},\omega)r_{mn}\ ,   \]</span></h5>
<h5>
where \(\bar{E} = (E_m + E_n)/2\) is the average energy, \(\omega = E_m - E_n\) 
is the energy difference, \(\Omega\) is the density of states, and the 
\(r_{mn}\) are erratically varying numbers with zero mean and unit variance. 
Moreover, \(O(\bar{E})\) and \(f(\bar{E},\omega)\) are smooth functions of 
their arguments. In particular, the smooth function \(O(\bar{E})\) will coincide 
with the microcanonical expectation value of \(O\) and, due to the smallness of 
the off-diagonal elements (which are suppressed by the exponentially large 
\(\Omega\)), thermalization is guaranteed. That is, \(\overline{\langle 
O(t)\rangle} = \sum_{m=n} |c_m|^2 O_{mm}\) will agree (up to small 
fluctuations) with the microcanonical equilibrium value independent of the 
choice of the initial state (i.e., the coefficients \(c_m\)).
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
Even after 30 years, the ETH is still and active area of research. One 
particular question that has recently attracted increased interest is concerned 
with the 
statistics of off-diagonal elements \(O_{mn}\) (or \(r_{mn}\)), that is, to 
better understand their 
pseudo-randomness and their residual mutual correlations. Consider the 
following 
sketch, which shows the matrix representation of a realistic operator written 
in the eigenbasis of some chaotic quantum system. If we take a submatrix 
at some fixed average 
energy \(\bar{E}\) and small energy width \(\Delta E\), then the matrix 
elements indeed look rather random, as predicted by the ETH Ansatz above (note 
that the sketch depicts real numerical data).

   <h5>
In a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.102.042127">pager</a> together 
with my colleagues, we 
approached the question of randomness of the \(r_{mn}\) in the following 
way. Given the small submatrix, we systematically set off-diagonal matrix 
elements above some cutoff frequency \(\omega_c\) to zero. For these banded 
\(\omega_c\)-dependent matrices, we then obtain their eigenvalue distribution 
\(P(\lambda)\) by diagonalizing the matrix.    
What we found is, when going to sufficiently small \(\omega_c\), 
\(P(\lambda)\) approaches the well-known Wigner semicircle distribution of 
random matrices. Thus, at sufficiently small energy scales, correlations 
between the \(r_{mn}\) seem to vanish and genuine random-matrix behavior 
emerges.
</h5>

               </div>
       </div>
       </div>

<h5>
More recently, we have refined this line of thought by introducing more (easier 
accessible) criteria for the emergence of genuine random-matrix behavior. 
Moreover, we have developed efficient numerical techniques to study these 
criteria for systems sizes beyond the range of standard tools, see <a 
href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.180601">here</a> and <a 
href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.20264">here</a> for more details. 
In a nutshell, what we found is a hierarchy of time scales (or, 
correspondingly, energy scales) in the thermalization process of isolated 
quantum systems. Specifically, random-matrix behavior only sets in at a time 
that is much longer (or, an energy scale that is much smaller) than the naive 
thermalization time scale of the system. Understanding how these different time 
(or energy) scales depend on the system size is a challenging question which we 
tried to at least partially address as well.  
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
So, let us come back to our original question: Why is thermalization such an 
ubiquitous phenomenon? Well, first of all, most systems around us are actually 
not isolated, but are constantly interacting with their environment. This much 
bigger environment provides a reservoir to exchange energy and facilitates the 
relaxation of the systems to thermal equilibrium. The study of such "open" 
systems is an important and interesting subject on its own. More 
microscopically, however, and even when considering perfectly isolated 
systems, it is also certainly true that the vast majority of such quantum 
many-body 
systems will indeed fulfill the ETH. While proving this observation is not 
straightforward, there is countless high-quality numerical evidence for it. 
Over the last decades, the ETH has become a major cornerstone for our 
understanding of thermodynamic behavior in quantum systems.
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
It is intriguing to ask if there are exceptions to the rule, i.e., systems that 
do not thermalize and do not obey the ETH. Certainly enough, the answer to this 
question is a firm "Yes!". While enormous progress in this direction has been 
made in recent years, it might be fair to say that our understanding of the 
different classes of ETH-violating systems is still incomplete. Nevertheless, 
the ETH has provided a helpful framework to approach these problem and has 
inspired many researchers to work in this area over the last years. I am 
sure that the ETH (including its generalizations and more fine-tuned 
aspects) will remain a significant strand of modern research also in the 
years to come.
