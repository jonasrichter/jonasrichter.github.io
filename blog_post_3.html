          <h2> California, Casino, and Clifford circuits </h2>
          <h6> 20. March 2023 </h6>
          <br>
           
          <h5>  It's been a while since my last blog entry. The beginning 
of the year has been busy, but now I finally managed to sit down and 
write 
some paragraphs about what has happened in the last couple 
weeks and, of course, about some physics stuff that I am currently interested 
in. </h5> 
<br>
<h5> 
Weather-wise, the Californian winter has been surprisingly unstable. While I am 
definitely happy to avoid the cold and snowy European version (as well as all 
the other winter storms that happened elsewhere in the US), I learned that the 
sun is not always shining in California. It has been raining quite heavily over 
the last couple months. Moreover, the rain is usually accompanied by strong 
winds and, given the sometimes interesting American infrastructure, I am 
writing these 
lines during the second power outage we had in two months. Having lived in 
Germany for 27 years, I cannot remember a single blackout. Now, during 2.5 years 
in the UK and the US, this is already the fourth time that I have to rely on 
candlelight in the evening. 
</h5>
<br>
 <h5>  
On another note, the APS March Meeting took place last week in Las Vegas. I 
have been looking forward to this event for quite some time. Overall, it was a 
lot of fun! I met some colleagues and friends from Europe, listened to some 
interesting talks, and went on a day trip to the amazing Valley of Fire. In 
hindsight, however, I must admit that this year's March Meeting will not make my 
all-time favorite-conference list. The convention center 
was simply way too small such that many sessions ended up overcrowded which 
made it hard to enjoy the talks. Moreover, food options in Las Vegas were in my 
opinion not too great and, even though I am used to 
Silicon-Valley prices, 
everything was remarkably expensive.    
</h5> 
<br>
<h5>
At the March Meeting, I presented a talk about my recent publication on 
transport 
and entanglement growth in long-range random Clifford circuits that I worked on 
in collaboration with Oliver Lunt (Kings College London) and Arijeet Pal 
(University College London). I was positively surprised that a lot of 
people visited the session despite being scheduled on Friday morning. Also, 
at least from what I can tell from my biased point of view, I think that my 
talk went quite well and I was happy to get many good questions from the 
audience (the speaker after me didn't show up which gave me some bonus time).
</h5>
<br> 
<h5>
Let me try to explain why I am 
currently quite excited about working on Clifford circuits (though there 
probably exist already much better resources that 
are more visual and more pedagogical). First of all, when 
you are used to the usual limitations of numerical simulations in quantum 
dynamics, working with Clifford circuits is extremely enjoyable! In particular, 
in contrast to fully generic quantum evolution, Clifford circuits can be 
efficiently simulated on classical computers such that huge system sizes and 
long time scales can be accessed. This can be extremely useful as some 
effects can only be clearly analyzed if the systems are large enough.  
</h5>
<br> 
<h5>
Usually, in order to describe the state of a many-body quantum system, the 
computer's memory has to store a complex vector, with the number of entries 
growing exponentially with the size of the system. For example, given a 
system of <math>L</math> qubits (i.e., <math>L</math> coupled two-level units), 
one needs to store 
(and manipulate!) <math>2<sup><math>L</math></sup></math> complex numbers. 
Therefore, despite the increasing power of computers, relatively small quantum 
systems somewhere 
between <math>L = 20</math> to <math>L = 45</math> can push even modern 
supercomputers to their limits (depending on some details of the system and what 
exactly one wants to compute).
</h5>
<br>
<h5> 
In contrast, in the case of Clifford circuits, systems with thousands of qubits 
can be simulated even on a laptop. This is possible if one only considers  
so-called stabilizer states. These stabilizer states have the property that 
they can be uniquely specified by a set of Pauli-strings (i.e., operators 
composed of Pauli matrices at different sites). Using this fact, stabilizer 
states can be 
compactly represented in the form of a binary matrix that only grows linearly 
in the number of qubits. Importantly, acting on a stabilizer state with a 
unitary operation that belongs to the Clifford group will yield another 
stabilizer state. Therefore, memory and time requirements to simulate 
circuits that consist entirely of Clifford elements don't exhibit the 
exponential explosion that occurs for other classes of quantum dynamics.    
</h5> 
<br> 
<h5>
Is the quantum dynamics studied in Clifford circuits generic (i.e., does it 
reflect the vast majority of non-fine-tuned quantum systems)? 
The answer is clearly no. As explained above,   
not all quantum states can be generated using the Clifford framework. 
Nevertheless, Clifford circuits can still prove useful as they mimic certain 
properties of more generic quantum evolutions, e.g., they generate extensive 
amounts of entanglement.  
</h5>
<br> 
<h5>
In our <a 
href="https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.
L012031">paper</a>, we use Clifford circuits to study the interplay of transport 
and 
entanglement growth in quantum systems. Specifically, earlier work has 
demonstrated that in quantum systems with diffusive transport, this 
diffusive transport leaves a fingerprint in the dynamics of entanglement which 
in turn 
grows slower 
than traditionally expected. In our paper, we consider long-range systems where 
the transport 
behavior can be tuned to different regimes by varying the power law that 
controls the range of interactions in the circuit. In a nutshell, we find that 
for all these regimes, the entanglement growth mimics the transport behavior 
and is controlled by the same dynamical exponent. Another nice thing about 
Clifford circuits is that due to their comparatively simple structure, it is 
possible to come up with easy-to-understand pictures to explain our results.   
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
Recently, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10129">we also studied</a> other 
types of Clifford circuits - namely Floquet circuits where the spatially random 
gates occur in a time-periodic fashion. As a main result, we show that these 
circuits exhibit a strong form a localization in one dimension, but are 
delocalized in two dimensions. Localization is quite an active research area in 
quantum many-body physics and I personally find it quite interesting to shed 
light on this question using Clifford dynamics. Generally, I believe it is an 
intriguing direction to better understand what types of exotic nonequilibrium 
quantum 
phenomena can be modeled using Clifford circuits. I hope to study this 
question in more detail in the future. 
</h5>
<br>
<h5> 
Finally, I share with you two pictures. The first one is an adapted figure 
from our publication on Clifford circuits that I presented at the March 
Meeting. The second one shows me enjoying the beautiful landscape of the Valley 
of Fire (thanks to Tjark Heitmann for taking this photo).
