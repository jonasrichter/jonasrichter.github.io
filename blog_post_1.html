          <h2> Moving to California as a Marie Curie Fellow </h2>
          <h6> 14. November 2022 </h6>
          <br> 
          <h5> Working in academia as a postdoctoral researcher has positive 
and negative sides. Very often postdocs only 
spend a short time, say two to three years, at a given place before moving on 
to the next (postdoc) job at a new institution in a different city, or 
even in another country. Whether this frequent moving counts as positive or 
negative at the end of the day is probably up to personal taste, but it is for 
sure exciting and daunting at the same time. </h5>
<h5>For the last two years, I was 
living in London - the beautiful capital of the United Kingdom - where I was 
a postdoc doing research in quantum physics at University College London. 
Together with 
my wife, we moved to London from Germany in 2020 in the middle of the Corona 
pandemic. Unsurprisingly, London turned out to be an amazing city (with 
surprisingly better weather than often claimed), and UCL is a great university 
with brilliant people from whom I learned a lot.</h5> 
<h5>In spring of 2022, 
however, a 
new life chapter started to announce itself - unbelievable but true, I was 
notified that my application for a competitive Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie 
Postdoctoral Fellowship was indeed successful. My project MaBoQuaCo, or in long 
form,
"<i>Quantum Many-Body Dynamics and Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Computers: 
Interconnections, Near-Term Applications, and Novel Simulation Schemes</i>" was 
selected to be generously funded by the European Research Commission. The 
project has a duration of 2.5 years and opens up the fantastic opportunity to 
conduct independent research at two world-leading universities - Stanford 
University in the US, and Leibniz Universität Hannover in Germany - where I 
will be kindly hosted by the groups of V. Khemani and T. J. Osborne, 
respectively. After two years in the UK, we eventually said goodbye to 
London in September 2022. </h5>
          
<h5> Fast forward to today, I am now working since two weeks in my new 
position. In the proposal that I submitted to 
the European Commission, I have outlined my research ideas that I intend to 
pursue over the course of the project. Broadly speaking, I will study various 
aspects of nonequilibrium quantum matter, with a particular focus on 
applications of current or near-term noisy quantum computers. Quantum computers 
harness the laws of quantum mechanics and promise to solve certain problems more 
efficiently than their classical counterparts. One such problem is the 
simulation of many-body quantum systems out of equilibrium, which is notoriously 
difficult for conventional - classical - computers as the computational 
requirements grow dramatically (that is, exponentially) with increasing the size 
of the quantum system. </h5>

<h5>Unfortunately, fully-fledged quantum computing is still 
far into the future and today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices 
are prone to errors due to the influence of the environment and imperfect 
control over the qubits. Building on the background that I 
gained during my PhD in Osnabrück and my postdoc in London, my 
goal for this project is to advance our understanding of the universal 
properties of quantum dynamics, for instance in driven-dissipative systems, in 
circuit models comprised of unitary gates potentially interspersed 
with measurements, and in many-body localized systems coupled to a 
thermal bath. Progress in these directions will help to unravel the 
inevitable interaction of NISQ devices with their environment and, in turn, will
hopefully lead to more robust and scalable NISQ simulations. Similarly, the 
necessity to benchmark larger and larger NISQ devices may give rise to new 
efficient numerical simulation methods that can be used to tackle 
challenging questions with classical computers. I will share more details on 
the progress of my 
project in future posts in this blog.     
</h5>

<h5> Stanford University, and especially the Geballe Laboratory for Advanced 
Materials where I am currently located, is a great place to do Physics - there 
is free 
coffee (and free donuts on Mondays). Most importantly, one is surrounded by 
incredibly intelligent and inspiring people who are experts in cutting-edge 
analytical, numerical, or experimental techniques, and study questions at the 
forefront of current research. Working in this setting is definitely an 
amazing, but also humbling, 
experience. From my first two weeks, I further have the impression that 
there 
definitely exists a form of work-life balance (in case one is allowed to have 
such a thing as a postdoc): everyone works extremely hard, but one 
also gets rewarded by California's sunny weather, an abundance of leisure 
activities, and the remarkable natural beauty that the San Francisco 
Bay Area has to offer.</h5> 

<h5>Moving to a new country, however, also entails a 
number 
of unavoidable administrative tasks that can consume a big chunk of mental 
capacity and can be quite detrimental to one's productivity (everyone who 
has moved abroad before can probably relate). Nevertheless, I am starting to
explore various different research direction and am gaining more and 
more momentum every day. I am very much looking forward to what the next months 
have in store.
