          <h2> Simulating quantum transport in closed and open quantum 
systems  
</h2>
          <h6> 20. October 2023 </h6>
          <br>
           
          <h5>
        In a previous post, I already discussed my interest 
in transport phenomena occurring in many-body quantum systems. In a nutshell, 
the question is how an inhomogeneous distribution of some globally conserved 
quantity relaxes to thermal equilibrium over the course of the system's time 
evolution. 
While one naively expects the emergence of diffusion (and sure 
enough, diffusion indeed arises in the majority of systems), there also 
exist systems which feature anomalous types of hydrodynamics. Generally, 
given the complexity of many-body quantum systems, it is quite challenging to 
simulate their transport characteristics and to extract 
precise (quantitative) values for their transport coefficients (e.g. the 
diffusion constant).
          </h5>
<br>
<h5>
From a practical (or say numerical) point of view, there are essentially two 
main approaches to explicitly simulate the transport properties of a given
many-body quantum systems. The first approach relies on the theory of linear 
response, where one considers the relaxation of small fluctuations of the 
system around its equilibrium state. These fluctuations are captured by 
time-dependent correlation functions evaluated within an equilibrium ensemble, 
e.g.,   
</h5>
<h5><span class="math display">\[ C(r,t) = 
\frac{\text{tr}[e^{-\beta H}\mathcal{O}_0 
\mathcal{O}_r(t)]}{\text{tr}[e^{-\beta H}]}\ .  \]</span></h5>
<h5>
<h5>
Here, \(\beta = 1/T \) is the inverse temperature, \(H \) is the Hamiltonian of 
the system, and \(\mathcal{O}_0 \) and \(\mathcal{O}_r \) are local 
operators separated by a distance \(r \). Moreover, the 
time argument indicates the time-evolved operator at time \(t \). To 
be specific, let's consider a system with conserved total magnetization 
\(\sum_\ell S_\ell^z \), and let \(\mathcal{O}_\ell \) be local spin operators 
\(S_\ell^z \). Then, in principle, one can infer the transport properties of 
\(H \) from the 
space- and time-dependence of \(C(r,t) \). In practice, however, it is only 
possible to simulate \(C(r,t) \) for systems of finite size (often quite small) 
and only for a finite time \(t \). Thus a finite-size scaling 
analysis is required in order to estimate the asymptotic transport 
characteristics 
for systems in 
the thermodynamic limit.
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
In the second approach, the system of interest is coupled at its boundaries to 
reservoirs (we here restrict ourselves to one-dimensional systems for 
simplicity). 
These reservoirs might for instance lead to different temperatures or chemical 
potentials at the system's ends, thereby 
inducing a nonequilibrium situation and driving a current through the system. 
In the long-time limit, a nonequilibrium steady-state will emerge. In 
particular, the transport characteristics can then be obtained by studying the 
distribution of the conserved quantity as well as by studying how the current 
changes upon varying the length \(L \) of the system. For example, in a 
perfect conductor (which exhibits ballistic transport), the current will be 
independent of \(L \). On the other hand, in the case of diffusion, the current 
scales as \(j \propto L^{-1} \). We refer to this 
approach of simulating transport properties as the <i>open-system</i> approach.
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
Naturally, one expects that both these approaches (closed vs open) should 
yield the same results (e.g., the same value of the diffusion constant). 
However, when studying systems of 
finite size numerically, one often observes notable deviations. One reason for 
these deviations (in addition to the finite system size) might be that the 
open-system approach depends on multiple 
parameters, e.g., how strongly the system is coupled 
to the reservoirs, as well as the amplitude of the driving due to the baths 
(e.g., 
the temperature difference between the left and the right baths). How can we 
know then which results we should trust? And how can we be sure that both 
approaches asymptotically yield the same answer in the thermodynamic limit?
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
In a series of two papers (see <a 
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10528">here</a> and <a 
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00430">here</a> for details), we tried to 
address 
this conceptual gap and to explicitly connect the results of both approaches 
with each other. As is standard in the literature, the open-system 
setup (i.e., the coupling to the bath) is modeled by a Lindblad quantum master 
equation, involving suitably chosen jump operators that induce/remove 
magnetization, 
</h5>
<h5><span class="math display">\[ 
\mathcal{D} \rho(t) = \sum_j \alpha_j \left(L_j \rho(t) L_j^\dagger - 
\frac{1}{2}\lbrace \rho(t),L_j^\dagger L_j\rbrace \right)\ ,  \]</span></h5>
<h5>
where \(\rho(t) \) is the density matrix of the system.
In the simplest setting, we can consider a 
scenario with only a single bath in the middle of the system (see below), 
e.g., 
</h5>
<h5><span class="math display">\[ 
L_1 = S_{L/2}^+\ ,\quad \alpha_1 = \gamma(1+\mu)\ , \\  L_2 = S_{L/2}^-\ ,\quad 
\alpha_2 = \gamma(1-\mu)\ , \]</span></h5>
<h5>
where for \(\mu > 0 \) excess magnetization is induced, which is then 
transported through the system.

In order to make a connection between the Lindblad framework and the 
equilibrium correlation function written above, we choose to unravel the 
Lindblad equation in terms of stochastic quantum trajectories. These 
trajectories require the time evolution of pure states (as opposed to the mixed 
state \(\rho(t) \) in the Lindblad equation) with respect to an effective 
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, as well as the application of jump operators to 
these states at randomly chosen times. Averaging over sufficiently many such 
trajectories then recovers the dynamics of the open system. Moreover, at time 
\(t = 0 \), the ensemble of pure states has to be chosen is a way that 
correctly represents the initial density matrix \(\rho(0) \). In our case, we 
consider a 
system that is initially in equilibrium at formally infinite temperature, which 
corresponds to choosing completely random pure states for the stochastic 
unraveling.  
</h5>
<br>      
<h5>
The randomness of the pure initial states in the stochastic unraveling enters 
as a key ingredient for our derivation. We can use this 
randomness, in combination with the concept of quantum typicality (see, e.g., 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05289">here</a> for an introduction to 
typicality), in order to connect the pure-state trajectories to equilibrium 
correlation functions. In particular, we show that in the limit of weak 
system-bath coupling and weak driving, the dynamics of the open system can be 
written as a superposition of closed-system linear-response correlation 
functions. 
</h5>
<br>
<h5>
This novel connection between open-system and closed-system dynamics has 
conceptual as well as practical consequences. On one hand, it provides a nice 
theoretical foundation that both numerical approaches (linear response vs 
Lindblad) will yield the same transport behavior, at least when the 
involved parameters are chosen appropriately. On the other hand, it is 
important to note that the evaluation of linear-response correlation functions 
is numerically much less costly than a full stochastic unraveling. Therefore, 
when interested in the dynamics of weakly coupled/driven open quantum 
systems, the superposition of closed-system correlation functions that we 
derived in the paper provides a more efficient simulation method.
